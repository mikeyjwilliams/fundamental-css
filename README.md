# Fundamental Css

>Fundamental CSS is a sass based utility library. This is a project to focus not on the product primarily, but to learn about agile development, user stories, build systems, researching tools. So in general this project is more understanding, making the how you got there as clean, neat, versatile as possible, and being able to explain it and once you do that explain the basic ways they can customize it. Also, once sections are done plans are to go back and try to refactor for better readability, cleaner code, and more streamlined code blocks.
