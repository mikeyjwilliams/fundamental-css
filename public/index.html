            Sassy Util Library is a customizable sass driven project. As a free
            free open source library. It is always in progress, and can always
            be contributed too if asked how. Sassy Util Css builds off of
            <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">
              Normalize.css
            </a>
            to get a flat surface no matter which browser your working on gives
            you the same start. At the moment this project is not ready for any
            coding projects without a lot of customization. Hopefully by version
            0.5.0 or so it it will be useable but till then it will just be a
            project in progress.

            This project has a lot of inspiration from many other frameworks and
            libraries. To help create ideas on what direction to go in, learning
            more advanced skills from, and to help create user stories. Any

            With this project, I am exploring new sass functions, build tools,
            exploring css styles I have not thought about for a long while, and
            much more. I wanted a fun side project so I thought this would be an
            interesting one to have running. Many opportunities to explore css
            and sass functions and modularizing it and learning more dry
            programming skills. As my skills grow in CSS and SCSS I hope to add
            some interesting things to this project.

            Most CSS Frameworks work too hard
          </h2>
          <p>
            They arrive with every component prebuilt just how they want it
            which makes your site look very cookie cutter. So you move fast, but
            look the same, then when it comes time to do custom work brings
            headaches to the table how to name things.
          </p>
          <p>Sassy Util Library tries to keep this to a minimum.</p>
          <p>
            Instead of giving you a bunch of prebuilt components, we supply you
            the low level utility classes that you build your own custom designs
            with. You do what your good at, we do our best to supply the css to
            make the magic happen with.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those who want to customize and build out classes, we try to
            provide all the needed placeholder styles or mixin styles to get the
            job done. While we do provide these, if not used they do not
            increase your css build.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note, we are a work in progress</b> continually building more
            utilities, trying to give a large selection of helper classes. So
            you do not have to override unwanted styles, or battle specificity
            wars, we just want to provide an easily customizable, sass developer
            friendly utility class.

          <p>
            Being built in SCSS, Sassy Util Library is highly customizable.
            Sassy aims to let you truly customize just about anything to make it
            yours. Whether this is fonts, colors, or more to come. Even up to
            going into the sass files and changing the naming conventions if
            that is what you wish to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sassy Util Css is more than a library, it is built to help create
            design systems.

            By changing the color to your preference and running the sass
            compiler you can fully customize your own swatches to be your own
            colors. More on how to customize is discussed in the customization
            page for that module. {/* link to customization page */}
