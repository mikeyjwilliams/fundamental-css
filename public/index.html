						Sassy Util Library is a customizable sass driven project. As a free
						free open source library. It is always in progress, and can always
						be contributed too if asked how. Sassy Util Css builds off of
						<a to="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">
							Normalize.css
						</a>
						to get a flat surface no matter which browser your working on gives
						you the same start. At the moment this project is not ready for any
						coding projects without a lot of customization. Hopefully by version
						0.5.0 or so it it will be useable but till then it will just be a
						project in progress.

					<p className="font-d-black--200">
						This project has a lot of inspiration from many other frameworks and
						libraries. To help create ideas on what direction to go in, learning
						more advanced skills from, and to help create user stories. Any
						works that this is a derivative of knowingly are MIT Licensed. If
						any works are used there name and what work they built that is

						Why Sassy Util Library...
					</h2>
					<p className="font-d-black--200">The PVD goal is to provide</p>
					<ol>
						<li>a low level utility library</li>
						<li>the ability to be turned into a custom framework</li>
						<li>it is easy to turn it into a framework</li>
						<li>it is easy to create documentation for it</li>
						<li>it has enough documentation to use it</li>
						<li>it has enough documentation to customize it</li>
					</ol>

					<p className="font-d-black--200">
						With this project, I am exploring new sass functions, build tools,
						exploring css styles I have not thought about for a long while, and
						much more. I wanted a fun side project so I thought this would be an
						interesting one to have running. Many opportunities to explore css
						and sass functions and modularizing it and learning more dry
						programming skills. As my skills grow in CSS and SCSS I hope to add
						some interesting things to this project.
